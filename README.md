# Vanilla Framework (in React)

This is a simple implementation of Vanilla Framework using React.

In the project directory, you can run:

## `./run`

This will start up an interactive development & testing environment listing all components.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `./run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

## `./run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
